        <h2>Happy Birthday</h2>
      <ul id='tribute-info'>
      <li>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of October in 2008, Faith was born, and boy is she a blessing to this Earth.</li>
      <li>Your birthday is coming up and so I would like to wish you a happy birthday (early). It sucks that I can't spend time with you on your birthday, I would love to just enjoy the day with you.</li>
      <li>Our story is a rollercoaster ride, and it has been an enjoyable one. From the beginning at Sengoda to how close we are now, the experience has been worthwhile</li>
      <li>They are a countless number of things that I've always thought about you but never had the time, words or place to express. But I have the chance to do so now.</li>
      <p class="li">You are overall just an amazing human, a beautiful partner and great companion, but that doesnt even sum it up</p>
      <li>You're funny, I find myself laughing everytime I talk to you.</li>
      <li>You're beautiful, I smile when I see your face or when I hear your voice. Your cuteness makes me blush and seeing you blush makes me melt</li>
      <li>Your body is insane &#128525. I want to run my hands up and down your perfect curves. Your tits are fucking gorgeous (even though i'm sad I haven't seen them yet &#128542) and your ass is a fantastic bubble butt. It all just turns me on &#128584</li> 
      <li>The way you show love and care is so heartwarming, and it's a marvel that I got to witness it</li>
      <li>If I'm being honest, you're just the perfect person and I love that about you.</li>
      <li>Distance shows you fake love and shows you what's real. And distance makes the heart grow fonder. Two things I found out to be true when I was with you.</li>

      <figcaption id='img-caption'><span>That's us</span></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>If there's one thing I learnt in this whole saga with you, it's that you never know how much you love someone until they hurt you.</li>
      <li>I will always be there when you need me and you'll always hold a special place in my heart&#128150&#128521 Once again Faith, Happy Birthday, may your wish be granted and may God bless you.</li>
      <li>Right now, all that's missing is your nude pics so I can create a gallery of your sexiness &#128527 But if our kids were to see this then it would be awkward &#128514</li>
      <p class='luv'>For now that's all I have to say. I love you</p>
